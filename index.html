    <h2>Welcome to Hogwarts!</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom:20px;">
    <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hogwarts_Houses">Hogwarts</a> School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was divided into <u>four Houses</u>: <strong>Gryffindor</strong>, founded by Godric Gryffindor; <strong>Hufflepuff</strong>, founded by Helga Hufflepuff; <strong>Ravenclaw</strong>, founded by Rowena Ravenclaw; and <strong>Slytherin</strong>, founded by Salazar Slytherin.

    Each House has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule breaking will lose House points. At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honour. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours.
